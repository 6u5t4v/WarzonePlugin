# WarzonePlugin
A custome made plugin made by me for my minecraft server "Furnesse" (play.Furnesse.com).
The idea for this plugin is to add some features to the warzone since the server is based around that, 
this is adding warzone-ores which lets players mine specific ores or blocks set in config, and instead
of the blocks just dissapearing, it will turn to a placeholder block (set in config), and then after
an amount of time the placeholder block will turn back to its original block.
Almost all features in this plugin is customizable, everything from language, simple recipes, custom drops, luck drops, gem-items, 
custom sell prices and much more.
